(human or computer), and reports both Player's scores for each round and
at the end of each game.

To start the game: python rps.py

## Gameplay Criteria:
1. The program plays a game of Rock Paper Scissors, following the
   conventional rules.
2. The program plays a match consisting of multiple rounds, and tracks
   players' total score.
3. There are at least four different computer player classes, each
   implementing a different strategy.
4. Each player class has a method that returns that player's move,
   and a method for remembering information about the round.

## Object-Oriented Programming Criteria:
1. The code uses classes and objects to store game data, rather than
   global variables.
2. The code uses subclasses appropriately.

## Code Style Criteria
1. The code style follows the standard Python style guide.
2. The program does not crash or display any error messages.
3. The program checks the validity of user input.
